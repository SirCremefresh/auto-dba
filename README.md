# Auto Dba

This is a kubernetes operator for managing access to external databases in kubernetes with CustomResources. I created this to learn more about kubernetres operators and to solve a usecase i had.    
But I will not support it because i found a similar project that solves the problem of managing external Databases in kubernetes. But this Project will stay for use as a Starter template to write a kubernetes Operator in Java.
Other Project: https://github.com/movetokube/postgres-operator   
   
I Presented this Project at a jug event. The slides can be found at: https://wolfisberg.dev/auto-dba-slides/
